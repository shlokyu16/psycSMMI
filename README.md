Research on Social Media affect on mental illness:

Objective:
Build an ML model that predicts a user's mental health risks (e.g., anxiety, depression, or general well-being) based on hypothetical social media interaction patterns. Develop a quiz-like interface to gather user data and assess their mental health risk.

Descrption:
We want to see the affects of social media on mental illness, negatively or positively. 
However, we also want to see how much the social media is bad for mental illness. 
This research is meant for future AI-wellness apps to detect mental problems, hence focusing slightly more on negative.
This research experimented with 9 different types of models, after the kind of data refining done by me. 
The front-end is a way of showing how the trained ai model is applied. A kind of application for this project.
The dataset only has about 500 people inputs. This research hence can be a bit of under yet it is efficient. Using a larger dataset might enhance the reliability of the model.

Why itâ€™s Beneficial:
Understanding the connection between social media behavior and mental health can inform the development of empathetic AI systems that prioritize user well-being. It directly contributes to creating AI systems capable of monitoring and intervening in mental health crises.

HAI Applications:
AI moderation tools that detect and respond to harmful content.
Digital assistants providing mental health recommendations.
AI-driven interventions for healthier online habits.
